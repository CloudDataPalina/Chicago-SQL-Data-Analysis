    "   2) `CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE ...` (with `--#SET TERMINATOR @`)\n",

    "   - **Positive scenario:**  \n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CALL UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE(610038, 38);\n",
    "     SELECT NAME_OF_SCHOOL, Leaders_Icon\n",

    "     WHERE School_ID = 610038;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Negative scenario (validation):**  \n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CALL UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE(610038, 101);\n",
    "     SELECT NAME_OF_SCHOOL, Leaders_Icon\n",
    "     FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS\n",
    "     WHERE School_ID = 610038;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "4. If needed, refresh the view or run `SELECT` on `CHICAGO_PUB_SCHOOLS` to see the aliased columns (`Leaders_Rating`, etc.).\n",
